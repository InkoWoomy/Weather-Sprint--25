### Weather Sprint - Client '25

This is a recreation of a figma for a weather application. It'll tell the user the weather of the city they inputted into search bar, as well as the 5-day forecast for that area.

The user can favorite their searches, either through the current weather or the history section, to view these cities at any time they wish. They are also able to remove these favorites from the favorites section if they are done using them.
